# Tracking Trade Partners Across the World

This application visualizes the changes in major trading partners worldwide. The data it uses is from the International Monetary Fund Direction of Trade Statistics. The colors represent the percentage of Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) in USD from either the EU, US, or China (whichever has the highest value for a given country).

- Running `api2.ipynb` allows you to do exploratory data analysis. It is only slightly modified from the version 1.0 notebook (from the other repository). I recommend using the interactive notebook instead.
- `data.json` is the processed data from the API
- Running `interactive.ipynb` allows you to look at data.
- `main.py` is a pipeline and is utilized if you want to run the code to get the data without any further EDA.
